            <h3><p>France – Brief History
                France, officially the French Republic, is a major European power with a rich history. Originally settled by Celtic Gauls, it was later conquered by Rome (51 BC). The Franks established a kingdom (5th century), leading to the Carolingian Empire under Charlemagne (800 AD). After feudal fragmentation, France emerged as a centralized monarchy, engaging in conflicts like the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453).

                The French Revolution (1789) overthrew the monarchy, leading to Napoleon’s First Empire (1804–1815). France saw political shifts between republics and monarchies in the 19th century, followed by the Third Republic (1870–1940). After WWII, the Fifth Republic (1958) stabilized governance under Charles de Gaulle.

                A global cultural hub, France is a permanent UN Security Council member, nuclear power, and top tourist destination</p></h3>

            <h3><p>The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France. Located at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, it was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 to honor the French army's victories. Completed in 1836, it stands 50 meters (164 feet) tall and features intricate sculptures and reliefs depicting battles and revolutionary events.

            Beneath the arch lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I, with an eternal flame that is rekindled daily. Visitors can climb to the top for a panoramic view of Paris. The Arc de Triomphe remains a symbol of French national pride and history.</p></h3>

    <h1>CROISSANT</h1>
        <img src="./croissant.jpg" alt="croissant">
            <h3><p>The croissant is a buttery, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry that is a staple of French breakfasts. Despite its strong association with France, it actually originated in Austria as the kipferl and was introduced to France in the 19th century.

            Made from laminated dough (layers of butter and dough folded repeatedly), croissants are light, crispy on the outside, and soft inside. They can be enjoyed plain, with jam, or filled with chocolate or almonds (pain au chocolat or croissant aux amandes).

            A true French croissant should have a golden, layered texture and a slightly sweet, rich flavor. It’s best served fresh and warm, often paired with coffee.</p></h3>

    <h1>COCO CHANEL</h1>
        <img src="./coco_chanel.jpg" alt="coco_chanel">
            <h3><p>Coco Chanel (1883–1971) was a revolutionary French fashion designer who founded the iconic Chanel brand. She redefined women's fashion by popularizing casual chic, the little black dress, tweed suits, and the legendary Chanel No. 5 perfume. Her interlocked-CC logo remains a global symbol of luxury.

            During World War II, Chanel faced controversy for her collaboration with Nazi officials, including a relationship with German spy Hans Günther von Dincklage. Though interrogated, she avoided charges, reportedly due to Winston Churchill's influence. After exile in Switzerland, she revived her brand in 1954, cementing her legacy as one of history's most influential designers.</p></h3>
